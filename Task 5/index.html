        Maharana Pratap (1540-1597) was a valiant king of Mewar, known for his
        unwavering spirit and dedication to his homeland. He is remembered for
        his bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and his fierce resistance
        against the Mughal Empire. Known for his unparalleled bravery and strong
        sense of honor, Maharana Pratap famously engaged in the Battle of
        Haldighati in 1576 against the Mughal emperor Akbar. Despite facing a
        vastly superior force, he displayed extraordinary tactical skill and
        courage, becoming a legendary figure in Indian history.
